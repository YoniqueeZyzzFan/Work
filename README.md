# What this code was created for

Finding a subsequence of length n in k sequences
</br>After finding the subsequences, you will enter a coefficient that shows how many days the same subsequence occurs

# How to use it
 For example, you have "abcd"
</br> words.push_back("abcd");
</br> length = 2  -  which means that you will search for all subsequences of length 2 /ab/ac/ad/bc/bd/cd
</br> gamma = 0,6 - Suppose the gamma is 0.6, so the same subsequence was found in 60% of the days

# Class Event and Class CustomEvent
If the event occurred in different places, this can be looked when searching for necessary data
